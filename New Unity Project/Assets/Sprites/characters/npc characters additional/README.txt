XCVG Systems - NPC Characters Additional

This is a handful of male and female person sprites used as background characters in Firefighter Simulator 2016/2017.

These are based on the NPC Characters by chasersgaming (https://opengameart.org/content/npc-characters-20), which were generously released as CC0 (public domain). The female variants were drawn before chasersgaming released their own pack of female characters so the style is considerably different.
